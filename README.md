# WeatherBot

WeatherBot is a project for Application Programming Interfaces for the Web course.

WeatherBot uses DialogFlow API and OpenWeatherMap API to make a bot whom you can ask about
current weather or the weather in a certain City. The Bot UI itself is made using BotUI Framework.

The API requests are done using Ajax and Fetch, and the data taken from recieved Json files, this app doesn't 
have any kind of backend with it and is all client side.

Asking about the current weather works using phrases like "Is it cold outside?" or "Hows the weather here?"
The bot understands some amout of variance with the questions. Asking about the weather in some city
such as "Hows the weather in Oslo?" provides the weather data for that city.
